The classes stored in the src/main/java/ were given by the professor and we were told NOT to modify them. The only thing I did was write up the JUnit test using Mockito in the src/test folder.

Disclaimer: I'm not sure if the tests written will work after the methods and/or classes stored in src/main/java are modified.
